# confconv

Configuration converter

## Why?

Ever had to convert config files from YAML to JSON to TOML?
This tool should be able to handle it.

## How?

Python loads config files as `dict`, and those dicts can be written again in a different format.

## More?

I'll add more formats as I see fit or as I need.
